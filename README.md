# AI-and-Gene_Chip_Data-project
This course project is about the classification problem of cells with different characteristics in the gene chip data. The classification problem is a very important part of machine learning. Through a lot of training, the machine sorts the input data into useful knowledge output and predicts the category from the result. And The classification includes binary classification and multivariate classification. This report proposed the Logistic Regression method and the Support Vector Machine method to train a classifier for binary and multivariate classification problem. And the model uesd principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of original data. In the other hand, the report tried to implement a deep learning model to do the same work as LR and SVM. By solving the same problem with different methods, we can understand the model more deeply and understand the difference between these methods.
